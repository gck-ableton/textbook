=========

Sairy is an experimental documentation preparation and extraction facility.  It
will use a pluggable and extensible architecture.

Requirements
------------

  - cmake >= 2.8.12
  - boost >= 1.54
  - libclang 3.5.0
  - a decent `c++11` enabled compiler, apple's clang "6.0" should do

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
